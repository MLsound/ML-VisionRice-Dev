    "\n",
    "### Experiment 1: _small & medium plant sizes_\n",
    "\n",
    "- mAP50-95(B): Achieved the highest score of 0.2264.\n",
    "- Precision: Moderate, around 0.33.\n",
    "- Recall: High, around 0.40.\n",
    "- Observations: This experiment demonstrates a good balance between precision and recall, resulting in the best overall performance in terms of mAP50-95(B).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 2: _small plant sizes_\n",
    "\n",
    "- mAP50-95(B): Lowest score among the three experiments.\n",
    "- Precision: Highest, around 0.45.\n",
    "- Recall: Lowest, around 0.25.\n",
    "- Observations: While precision is the highest in this setup, the significantly lower recall indicates that the model struggles to identify a large portion of actual objects. This suggests that with less data, the model becomes more selective, leading to fewer false positives but at the cost of missing out on many actual positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experiment 3: _medium plant sizes_\n",
    "\n",
    "- mAP50-95(B): Lower than Experiment 1 but higher than Experiment 2.\n",
    "- Precision: Lowest, around 0.28.\n",
    "- Recall: Highest, around 0.50.\n",
    "- Observations: This experiment prioritizes recall over precision. With the least amount of data, the model casts a wider net, capturing more actual positives but also including more false positives, hence the lower precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusions:\n",
    "- Dataset Size Matters: The size of the dataset used for fine-tuning plays a crucial role in the model's performance.\n",
    "- Trade-off between Precision and Recall: There's an evident trade-off between precision and recall. Depending on the application, one might be prioritized over the other. For instance, if it's critical to not miss any actual objects (e.g., in medical diagnosis), high recall would be preferred even at the cost of lower precision.\n",
    "- Optimal Balance: Using 50% of the dataset seems to provide the best balance between precision and recall for object detection tasks.\n",
    "- Further Exploration: It would be interesting to experiment with different dataset sizes and observe the changes in the model's performance. Additionally, exploring techniques to mitigate the impact of reduced dataset sizes, such as data augmentation or transfer learning, could be beneficial."
